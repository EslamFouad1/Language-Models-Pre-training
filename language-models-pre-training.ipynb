Pretraining language models on vast amounts of unstructured data has made it possible to create versatile models that can be fine-tuned for various natural language processing tasks.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis article provides an in-depth overview of pretraining techniques for language models such as Masked Language Models (MLM), Replaced Token Detection (RTD), Sentence Order Prediction, Whole Word Masking (WWM), and others. The article explains the theory behind each technique and provides detailed instructions for implementing them using widely-used deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, and HuggingFace Transformers.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe aim of the article is to equip readers with the comprehensive knowledge of these pretraining techniques and the ability to implement them in their own work.

The goal of pre-training is to create a model that can learn the structure and patterns of language, allowing it to develop a deep understanding of the language and generate coherent and contextually relevant responses.\n\nFine-tuning a pre-trained language model involves training the model on a smaller labeled dataset specific to the task, such as sentiment analysis, text classification, or named entity recognition. The pre-trained model is then adapted to the specific task, resulting in improved performance on that task. For example, a pre-trained model might be fine-tuned on a sentiment analysis task to classify movie reviews as positive or negative.\n\nSeveral pre-trained language models have shown significant improvements when fine-tuned on specific tasks. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a pre-trained model developed by Google, has been fine-tuned on a variety of tasks, including question-answering, natural language inference, and sentiment analysis, and has shown state-of-the-art performance on many benchmarks. Another example is GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2), a pre-trained model developed by OpenAI, which has been fine-tuned on a variety of tasks, including text completion, machine translation, and summarization, and has also shown state-of-the-art performance on many benchmarks.\n</p>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<center>\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/bert_models_layout.jpeg?ssl=1\"><br>\n<span>Transformers family.

The demonstration will highlight the benefits of pre-training language models for natural language processing applications and showcase how state-of-the-art language models can be developed.\n</p>\n<p>\nTo pretrain language models using the PyTorch framework, users need to write a Dataset class to process the data on a sample-by-sample basis. This allows for efficient data loading and processing during pretraining. The Dataset class is responsible for defining how the data is read, processed, and transformed into inputs that can be used by the language model. This typically involves tokenizing the input text and creating input-output pairs for pretraining tasks such as Masked Language Modeling or Replaced Token Detection.

In these cases, WWM can be more effective than MLM, which can sometimes mask only parts of words and make it harder for the model to learn the correct boundaries of named entities.\n</p>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1>Replaced Token Detection</h1>\n<p>\nReplaced Token Detection (RTD) is a pretraining technique for language models that involves replacing some tokens in the input with other tokens, and then training the model to predict which tokens have been replaced. This technique has been used in pretraining large-scale language models such as ELECTRA and DeBERTa v3.\n\nTo pretrain a model with RTD, a certain percentage of tokens in the input are randomly replaced with other tokens, and the model is then trained to predict which tokens have been replaced. During pretraining with RTD, the model minimizes a loss function that compares the predicted and actual tokens that have been replaced in the input. The loss function used for RTD is often binary cross-entropy, which calculates the difference between the predicted and actual labels for each replaced token, and then averages them across all replaced tokens in the batch. The model then updates its parameters based on the gradients of the loss function. By minimizing this loss function, the model learns to better distinguish between replaced and unchanged tokens and improve its ability to understand the context and relationships between words.\n</p>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<center>\n    <img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/B2xztMK/rtd.png\">\n</center>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1>Permutation Language Modeling</h1>\n<p>\nPermutation Language Modeling is a pretraining technique for language models that involves permuting the order of some input tokens, and then training the model to predict the original order of the tokens. Permutation Language Modeling can be much better than other pretraining techniques in cases where the task requires understanding long-range dependencies between tokens in a sequence, such as in natural language generation. By training the model to predict the original order of the tokens, it is forced to learn to capture these long-range dependencies, which can be difficult to learn with other pretraining techniques. Compared to Masked Language Modeling, which randomly masks some of the tokens in the input, Permutation Language Modeling requires the model to learn the correct order of all the tokens in the input sequence. While MLM can be effective for learning local context and word prediction, PLM has been shown to be better at capturing global dependencies and long-range relations between words. However, PLM can also be computationally expensive and can require larger amounts of training data to perform well.\n</p>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1>Span Masking / Predicting spans</h1>\n<p>\nSpan Masking is a pretraining technique for language models that involves predicting spans of text within a given document. This technique is often used in conjunction with other pretraining tasks, such as masked language modeling, to improve the quality of the language model's representations.\n    \nSpan Masking can be particularly beneficial in cases where the downstream task requires the model to identify specific pieces of information within a document, such as named entities, events, or relationships between entities. By pretraining the model to predict spans of text, it learns to identify important information within a document and can generate more accurate representations of that information.\n\nFor example, in the task of named entity recognition, the model must identify and classify mentions of named entities within a document. By pretraining the model to predict spans of text that correspond to named entities, it learns to identify and extract relevant information from the document, which can improve its performance on the downstream task.\n\nSequence-to-sequence models like T5 and BART were pre-trained using the Span Masking technique, as an example.\n    \nOverall, Span Masking can be a powerful pretraining technique for language models in tasks where identifying specific pieces of information within a document is important. However, it may not be as useful in tasks where the focus is on understanding the overall meaning or structure of the document.\n</p>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<center>\n<img src=\"https://psi9730.github.io/machinelearning-blog/assets/images/2019-11-11-SpanBERT-Improving-Pre-Training-By-Representing-And-Predicting-Spans-1.png\"><br>\n<span>Source: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10529\">SpanBERT: Improving Pre-training by Representing and Predicting Spans</a></span>\n</center>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1>Translation Language Modeling</h1>\n<p>\nTranslation Language Modeling (TLM) is a pretraining technique that has gained increasing attention in recent years.

The model is trained to maximize the similarity between positive examples and minimize the similarity between negative examples.\n\nTo train a model with contrastive learning, you first need to select a dataset and choose a set of positive and negative pairs of examples.

The training process typically involves training the model on a large dataset using a deep neural network and stochastic gradient descent optimization.\n    \nSentence-BERT is an example of a model that uses contrastive learning. The contrastive loss function used in SBERT encourages the model to learn representations that maximize the similarity between similar sentences and minimize the similarity between dissimilar sentences.
